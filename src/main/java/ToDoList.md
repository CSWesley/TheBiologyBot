# To-Do List

### Add these items:
`Medusagyne oppositifolia (Jellyfish Tree)`:
Thought to be extinct, this plant was newly rediscovered in the 1970s. There are approximately 86 worldwide.
$1000

`Cosmos atrosanguineus (Black Cosmos)`:
Even though this rare flowers has a fragrance of chocolate, it actually belongs in the family of daisies!
$700

`Candelabra Tree`:
Used for Brazilian indigenous remedies. They were previously popular for construction due to their straight trunks.
$500

`Nepenthes attenboroughii`:
Recently discovered in the Philippines and have bell shaped pitchers large enough to trap rats.
$300

`Ghost Orchid`:
This flower has a distinct, apple scented smell, and is highly sought after by collectors.
$200

### Make more economy commands:
1. `!rob [user]` => Robs a user with 50% chance of success and a random number of BioPoints 
from the users balance. If the user has not started a game, they cannot be robbed. Cool down
is 12 hours.

2. `!diceroll` => Rolls a 6 sided dice and returns the result. If you roll a `1` you get
100 BioPoints, a `2` you get 200 BioPoints, and so on. Cool down is 24 hours.

3. `!coinflip` => Flips a coin and returns the result. If you get `heads` you DOUBLE your 
BioPoints, if you get `tails` you LOSE all your BioPoints. Cool down is 24 hours. This is a 
BIG RISK.
