# To-Do List

### Make more economy commands
1. `!rob [user]` => Robs a user with 50% chance of success and a random number of BioPoints 
from the users balance. If the user has not started a game, they cannot be robbed. Cool down
is 12 hours.

2. `!diceroll` => Rolls a 6 sided dice and returns the result. If you roll a `1` you get
100 BioPoints, a `2` you get 200 BioPoints, and so on. Cool down is 24 hours.

3. `!coinflip` => Flips a coin and returns the result. If you get `heads` you DOUBLE your 
BioPoints, if you get `tails` you LOSE all your BioPoints. Cool down is 24 hours. This is a 
BIG RISK.

### Please suggest things. I will do it if you ask! :D
